<b>WARNING: nanomsg has not been released. It is still in pre-alpha stage.</b>

<p><i>nanomsg</i> library is a high-performance implementation of several "scalability protocols". Scalability protocol's job is to define how multiple applications communicate to form a single distributed application. Implementation of following scalability protocols is available at the moment:</p>

<ul>
<li>PAIR - simple one-to-one communication
<li>REQREP - allows to build clusters of stateless services to process user requests
<li>PUBSUB - distributes messages to large sets of interested subscribers
<li>FANIN - aggregates messages from multiple sources
<li>FANOUT - load balances messages among many destinations
<li>SURVEY - allows to query state of multiple applications in a single go
</ul>

<p>Scalability protocols are layered on top of transport layer in the network stack. At the moment, <i>nanomsg</i> library supports following transports:</p>

<ul>
<li>INPROC - transport within a process (between threads, modules etc.)
<li>IPC - transport between processes on a single machine
<li>TCP - network transport via TCP
</ul>

<p><i>nanomsg</i> library works with wide range of operating systems. It is implemented in C and has no extra dependencies except for functionality natively provided by the OS.</p>

<p>The library exposes a BSD-socket-like C API to the applications.</p>

<p>It is licensed under MIT/X11 license.</p>
