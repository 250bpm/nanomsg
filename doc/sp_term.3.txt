sp_term(3)
==========

NAME
----
sp_term - uninitialise the nanomsg library


SYNOPSIS
--------
*#include <sp/sp.h>*

*int sp_term (void);*


DESCRIPTION
-----------
Uninitialises the nanomsg library. If the library was initialised multiple
times, it is uninitialised only when _sp_term()_ call is executed
for each corresponding _sp_init()_ call.

Calling _sp_term()_ without prior call to _sp_init()_ results in undefined
behaviour.

To help with shutdown of multi-threaded programs nanomsg permits to call
_sp_term()_ while some are sockets still open. In such case _sp_term()_ call
blocks and waits while all the sockets are closed.

If a thread is blocked inside a blocking function, such as _sp_recv()_,
it will be unblocked once _sp_term()_ is called and ETERM error will be returned
to the user. Similarly, any attempt to invoke a socket function after
_sp_term()_ was called will result in ETERM error.


RETURN VALUE
------------
Returns zero in case of success. Returns negative value in case of error and
sets 'errno' to to one of the values defined below.


ERRORS
------
No errors are defined.
